            <h1>DEGROWTH ACTIVISTS YORK: RESPONSE TO EUDAIMONIABOT
            </h1>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                This statement is issued in response to EudaimoniaBot and its relation to the global degrowth movement, after many calls for an official message on its impact to our cause. 
            </p>

            <p>
                EudaimoniaBot has inspired a wave of renewed support for our movement, and we have seen large numbers of people changing their habits to more sustainable practices at a greater scale than ever before. We are pleased to see these results. At the same time, we are surprised at the lack of critique regarding multiple issues of EudaimoniaBot that are fundamentally opposed to degrowth. We feel it is our right and our responsibility to call out the destructive effects that EudaimoniaBot may have on both the climate and on our movement, even as we welcome its positive impact.
            </p>
        </div>

            <p>
                We share many of our ideals with those of EudaimoniaBot’s creators, Content.ai. We commend their support of the Amazon boycott, and we are pleased that a company is having a noticeable impact on peoples’ attitudes towards their consumption habits and their impact on the environment, whilst also bringing meaning into their lives through simpler modes of living. We as degrowth activists support the global movement that EudaimoniaBot has inspired: a movement that believes that living a life of flourishing (or, in Ancient Greek, 'eudaimonia') is the ultimate aim of life, and our society’s long-held obsession with economic growth has often been at odds with this goal. We see that EudaimoniaBot is helping people realise that economic growth is a construct that we are told is a necessity to keep society running, and that living on less may promote alternate forms of growth. For example, growth of public services, or of individual well-being, two areas which are shamefully ignored when the focus is purely on GDP growth. Degrowth has maintained since its origins that a life of flourishing is eminently reachable for all if we were to shift our collective priorities, and change has been limited only in helping others understand this revelation, and in encouraging habitual changes that supported lives of simple fulfilment. We applaud EudaimoniaBot for the impact it has had on educating people on degrowth values and in transitioning habits from the ultra-consumerist norm, to living more intentionally and with less consumption.

            <p>
                With these benefits noted, we believe that it is our responsibility to critique EudaimoniaBot for the ways in which it harms our movement and the environment, and why we now call for a rejection of EudaimoniaBot by the degrowth community.

            <h2>Issue #1: Complicity with OpenAI</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                EudaimoniaBot is powered by OpenAI’s advanced word embeddings to create the optimal chatbot experience. The consequence of this, since OpenAI is notorious for its detrimental impact on the environment, is that the partnership with Content.ai makes EudaimoniaBot complicit in these offences. This is well known but rarely commented on.

                OpenAI has continually reported excessive water usage during training. Since 2020’s GPT-3, which required 700,000 litres of freshwater to train, the company’s water requirements have roughly doubled every five years. EudaimoniaBot has separate data centres to supply their unique chatbot, which are also kept cool with water, bringing the total water usage of EudaimoniaBot to what we deem an unethical amount. Water is increasingly scarce throughout the world, particularly in areas most hit by adverse, arid weather conditions as a result of the climate crisis, and we feel that we cannot justify the hundreds of thousands of litres of freshwater that AI companies require to train their models.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                But training is only the first step in the life of a chatbot. Once deployed, every query to OpenAI’s servers uses around 1,700 joules of energy. With the millions of users that EudaimoniaBot now boasts, the total energy usage per hour is up to ten times greater than using Google search or streaming services for the same amount of time. The energy consumption of a bot that aims to curb unnecessary consumption should be at the forefront of conversations about its climate impact, and EudaimoniaBot’s consumption is simply too high for us to accept.
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Separate from its excessive consumption of resources, OpenAI has been the subject of many other disturbing investigations over the years. It has been found that the company paid its outsourced workers an exceptionally low rate of pay for labelling its training data - an essential service that AI now wholly relies on. OpenAI is also infamous for its involvement in multiple copyright court cases that threaten human creators’ entire livelihoods. These criticisms are major concerns for us. Low rates of pay force workers to work longer hours, which contributes to the excessive production-consumption cycle that is so detrimental to the environment, which is why we support a reduction in working hours. We also support creative work since this work is often not resource intensive, and interacting with creative products as both a producer and consumer is essential for human flourishing. The precarity of life and work that OpenAI forces on low-paid and creative workers is therefore opposed to degrowth.
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Content.ai's collaboration with OpenAI makes the company complicit with the climate offences and humanitarian offences that OpenAI has committed, and the company’s silence on this matter is disappointing. Our call for a boycott of OpenAI therefore necessarily entails a boycott of EudaimoniaBot for the same reasons.

            <h2>Issue #2: EudaimoniaBot was not necessary</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                We also critique the commonly held belief, shared even by many ardent degrowth supporters, that a chatbot with global popularity such as EudaimoniaBot was the only effective option that our movement had to change people's opinions at scale.

                This belief stems from the success of EudaimoniaBot in engaging in high-level conversation about life’s meaning and how it relates to patterns of production and consumption. Users who are unsure of how to live a more meaningful life in the face of our predatory corporate culture are jolted into action by EudaimoniaBot’s logical and incisive argumentation that slower, simpler lives lead to happier and healthier lives, and that living with a light material footprint can benefit the climate whilst at the same time provide deeper life satisfaction.

                We agree with all of the above; indeed, this description of EudaimoniaBot’s philosophy and method also serves as a description of what Degrowth Activists’ mission statement has been for decades. But we also believe in another principle: that human interaction is the foundational relationship in engaging people in movements. The conversations that EudaimoniaBot has been fostering are not AI dependent; humans could've had those conversations with each other. Degrowth activists are a large community and are always open to conversations. We should not feel dependent on AI chatbots to mediate these much needed discussions, all whilst providing a profit for companies and being complicit in OpenAI's worst climate offences. We can arrive at the same destination by much less contentious means.

                We do not merely believe that artificial intelligence is unnecessary for these discussions, but we believe that human beings provide a much more fulfilling service than artificial intelligence could ever do. Chatbots provide an individualised experience, involving one human and their machine, removing all possibility for interpersonal connection. Even as EudaimoniaBot has helped gain support for the global movement, many have had to relearn what community-driven action looks like, since chabot conversations remove a crucial aspect of human-to-human interaction. The individualism of EudaimoniaBot is in opposition to the communal nature of degrowth.

                We believe that we did not need EudaimoniaBot. Scientists have spent decades of research finding solutions to the climate crisis, and have laid out exact paths to do so, none of which were dependent on futuristic technological development. This was publicly available knowledge decades ago, before AI was a feature of social life. As we have made clear, EudaimoniaBot has been successful for our cause, but praising it as the only way in which we could have achieved what has been achieved allows for dangerous techno-utopian ways of thinking.
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                We do not need to hold out hope for technological fixes like EudaimoniaBot to save us from the climate crisis. To do so delays us from action. We as living and breathing humans are willing and able to have the difficult discussions that many wrongly claim are achievable only via an AI agent. And we do not need to be complicit in harmful climate and humanitarian practices in order to do so. It is humans that have got the world into this mess, humans who figured out how to get out of it, and humans who eventually will make that change happen.
